## 概念
有些物品被认为会给你带来好运，但这个物品却被认为是不幸的，是完全相反于幸运符的。当这个物品在一个角色手中时，会发生非常糟糕的事情，比如滑倒在[[香蕉皮]]上、被粘在人行道上溢出的胶水中、或者飞机突然耗尽燃料，在你的前面或后面坠毁。

本质上，这是一种被认为会带来不幸的物品，要么因为它奇怪的标记，要么因为它的恶魔形状或其他原因。如果你发现自己拥有其中之一，要小心。不幸符往往比幸运符更难丢掉或摆脱，其中许多都是[[缠扰式麦高芬]] 。

明显与[[幸运符]]相反。与[[死亡神器]]有关。对于角色形态的厄运符，请参见[[扫把星]]。

- 游戏[[《影之心系列》]]的金项链。每一条金项链的[[文案包装]]各不相同，但都会提到它的前任拥有者均因来自古埃及的诅咒而遭受可怕的命运。从游戏玩法来看，该配饰作为[[战斗诱饵]]，会增加双倍的战斗频率。
